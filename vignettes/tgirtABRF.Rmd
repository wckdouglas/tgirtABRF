tgirtABRF provides functions for labeling files from the work, *RNA-Seq of human reference RNA samples using a
thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptase*.  

Installing:
```
library(devtools)
install_github('wckdouglas/tgirtABRF')
```

To use the library:
```{r warning=F, message=F}
library(tgirtABRF)
library(dplyr)
```

The naming system that was used in the project is as follow:
``` {r echo=T}
df <- read.csv('names.csv',header=F) 
colnames(df) = 'names'
df

```

To extract the annotations from the sample names:
```{r}
df %>% 
    mutate(lab = getLab(names)) %>%     
    mutate(mixTemplate = getTemplate(names)) %>% 
    mutate(replicate = getReplicate(names)) %>% 
    mutate(prep = getPrep(names)) %>%
    data.frame()
```
